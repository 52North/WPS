It features a pluggable architecture for processes and data encodings.\r\nThe implementation is based on the current OpenGIS specification: 05-007r7.\r\n\r\nIts focus was the creation of an extensible framework to provide algorithms for generalization on the web.\r\n\r\nMore information available at the [52°North Geoprocessing Community](http://52north.org/geoprocessing).\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Full java-based Open Source implementation.\r\n* Supports all features and operations of WPS specification version 1.0.0 (document 05-007r7)\r\n* Pluggable framework for algorithms and XML data handling and processing frameworks\r\n* Build up on robust libraries (JTS, geotools, xmlBeans, servlet API, derby)\r\n\r\n## Supported Backends\r\n\r\nThe 52°North WPS provides wrappers to well-established (geographical) computation backends.\r\n\r\n* WPS4R - R Backend\r\n* GRASS out of the box extension\r\n* 220+ SEXTANTE Processes\r\n* Experimental Transactional Profile (WPS-T)\r\n* Web GUI to maintain the service\r\n* ArcGIS Server Connector\r\n\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nUse git to clone the WPS repository:\r\n\r\n`git clone https://github.com/52North/WPS.git`\r\n\r\nThen just run `mvn clean install` on the repositories root directory.\r\n\r\n## Integration Testing\r\n\r\nThe WPS comes with a variety of integration tests which are performed using Jetty.\r\nIn order to execute integration tests in a maven build, activate the dedicated profile\r\nthrough `mvn clean install -Pintegration-test`.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
